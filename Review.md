# Please answer the following questions

1.  In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?
  Describe breaks down your test into components to be able to see them better in when running the tests, and it is where you will have the tests written. It is good to do the describe to give more details about your test and it is used everytime you want to write a test.
2.  What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?
  The point of Test Driven Development is to write test first and then write a new functional code to make it work. I rather write the code first and then go back and do the tests. However, if I do the tests early on then I won't forget to do them.
3.  What are `mocks`? What are a good use cases for them?
    It is a technique to isolate test subjects with objects that you can control. I believe you would use this when you want to make sure a test is working but use a smaller data object then your site that can have a major data object in it.
4.  Mention three types of automated tests.
  The there types of test are unit tests, itegration tests, and functional testing.
